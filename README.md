# FreeHat

Wear items in your helmet slot.

## Abstract

Players may put item in their helmet slot which do not usually go
there. They do so via command or inventory interaction. Items are
denied if they offer exploits. For example, you cannot put a
chestplate in your helmet slot because it would grant an unusually
high armor boost.

## Commands

- `/hat` Put the item in your hand slot in your helmet slot.

## Permissions

- `freehat.hat` Use the `/hat` command.
- `freehat.click` Click in your inventory to wear an item on your head.
